# HUML (Human-oriented Markup Language)

A Java library for working with Human-oriented Markup Language (HUML), providing utilities for reading and writing structured data in a human-readable format.

## What is HUML?
HUML is a simple, strict, serialization language for documents, datasets, and configuration. It prioritizes strict form for human-readability. It looks like YAML, but tries to avoid its complexity, ambiguity, and pitfalls. Read more about it here - [huml.io](https://huml.io/).

> [!NOTE]\
> This library is currently in active development mode and a lot of features aren't built yet.
